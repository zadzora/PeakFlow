**PeakFlow** is a lightweight and beginner-friendly tool that lets you easily limit or "cap" the loudness of audio coming from your computer. It's especially useful when watching movies or listening to media late at night — no more sudden loud explosions or jumpscares waking up the whole house!

Other audio tools are often overloaded with complex sliders and settings. **PeakFlow** was built to keep things simple and automatic, with just the right amount of control.

## 💡 Why I Made This

I often found myself watching movies at night and being startled by loud effects or music, even with the volume turned low. Most existing solutions were either too complicated or unreliable. So I created **PeakFlow**: a minimal, no-nonsense tool for smooth late-night listening. 🎬🌙
